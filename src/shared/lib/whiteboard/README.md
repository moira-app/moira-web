An open-source digital whiteboard application. This project is a deep-dive learning exercise, using the excellent architecture of **tldraw** as a primary reference and starting point.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to build a functional, performant, and extensible digital whiteboard from the ground up. By studying the patterns and solutions implemented in `tldraw` (v2) and its legacy version (`tldraw-v1`), this project aims to explore concepts in:

* **State Management** for complex, interactive applications.
* **Rendering Engines** (SVG/Canvas) for dynamic UIs.
* **Geometric Calculations** and collision detection.
* **Tool and Interaction Systems** (selection, drawing, resizing, etc.).
* **Collaborative Features**.

This is first and foremost a learning journey.

## ✨ Planned Features

The initial feature set is inspired by the core functionalities of most whiteboarding tools.

* [ ] Infinite Canvas
* [ ] Pan & Zoom Controls
* [ ] Basic Shape Tools (Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Arrow)
* [ ] Freehand Drawing (Pen Tool)
* [ ] Text Tool
* [ ] Selection, Movement, and Resizing of Elements
* [ ] Color and Style Properties
* [ ] Undo / Redo Functionality
